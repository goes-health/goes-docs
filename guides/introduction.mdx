## Welcome to the GOES Health API

The GOES Health API provides real-time information about outdoor health and wildlife risks based on location. Our API helps outdoor enthusiasts, applications, and services make informed decisions about outdoor activities by providing:

- Health risk assessments (sunburn, heat illness, etc.)
- Wildlife risk assessments with prevalence scores
- Location-specific safety tips and precautions

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. You'll need to include your API key as a query parameter in all requests:

```bash
curl "http://api.goes.health/v1/risks?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&location=34.0522,-118.2437"
```

## Available Endpoints

The GOES Health API provides three main endpoints:

- `/v1/risks` - Get outdoor health risks for a location
- `/v1/wildlife` - Get wildlife risks and prevalence for a location
- `/v1/feedback` - Submit feedback about risk assessments

Each endpoint accepts a location parameter in the format of `latitude,longitude` and returns detailed information about risks in that area.

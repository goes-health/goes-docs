### Response

```json

  "summary": "For your planned hiking activity in the Santa Monica Mountains area with small children, there are several important considerations that require attention. The high UV index (8) poses a significant sunburn risk, especially for young children's sensitive skin, and this is particularly relevant given the lack of natural shade on many trails. There's also a moderate heat illness risk with temperatures reaching 85°F, which could feel more intense for children who may not recognize early signs of heat exhaustion.",

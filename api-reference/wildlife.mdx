      "tips": [
        "When in bear country, travel in groups. Make noise while you hike, especially around corners or near running water to avoid surprising a bear.",
        "If allowed where you're going, pack bear spray and learn how to use it properly. You can spray at a charging bear 20-30 feet away.",
        "Look for signs of bear activity: fresh scat (poop), paw prints, ripped bark on trees, or berry bushes.",
        "If you encounter a bear, do not run or appear like prey. Avoid eye contact and back away slowly while speaking in a loud, firm voice.",
        "Store scented items (toiletries, food, clothes you cooked in) in airtight containers at least 100 ft from camp."

      "tips": [
        "Snakes hang out under rocks and in long grasses. They're most active when it's warm and sunny out.",
        "Snakes feel vibrations because they don't have ears that can hear. Stomp or shuffle your feet so snakes can feel you approaching.",
        "If you're in rattlesnake territory, avoid wearing headphones so you can hear any warning rattles.",
        "Not all venomous snakes are rattlesnakes. Learn which venomous snakes are in the area and how to identify them.",
        "If bitten by a venomous snake, try to stay calm while you get to emergency medical care. Methods to slow or stop the venom will only make the bite worse."

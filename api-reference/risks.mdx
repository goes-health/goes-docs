        "Apply SPF 30+ sunscreen. Reapply every 2 hours (or more frequently depending on your personal history with sunburns or if you're sweating).",

        "Stay covered: wear a hat, long sleeves, sunglasses, sunscreen, or SPF-treated clothes",
        "Sunburns make it harder for your body to keep cool since you cannot sweat as effectively through burnt skin.",
        "Sunlight can also be reflected off bright surfaces like water or snow to give you a sunburn.",
        "Wear sunglasses. Your eyes can burn from reflected and direct light."

      "status": "applicable",
      "tips": [
        "Protecting your skin from the sun can help your body stay cool. Wear light and loose layers, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.",
        "Try to time your activity so that you take a break or find some shade during the hottest part of the day.",
        "Pack enough water for your activity. Drink water before starting an activity so you start out hydrated. Drink when you are thirsty.",
        "If you're drinking a lot of water, eat salty snacks to avoid low salt levels and overhydration.",
        "High humidity prevents sweat from evaporating and makes it harder to cool down. You will feel hotter on more humid days.",
        "Using a spray bottle to create a mist can help you feel cooler because of increased evaporative cooling.",
        "If you're overheated, cool down by submerging in cold water or dousing your hands, cheeks, and clothes in cold water."
